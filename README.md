# Advanced Refactor Tips

Welcome to art! Or as we may also call it, advanced refactor tips. We will also help with other things, but the main focus is to refactor.

## How to study

We have a list of examples, choose one, we recommend you going directly into the js files, there you are going  to see an horrible organized file. Your mission is to do your best to refactor and clean it. If you do not understand what you should do, them you would read the README file inside of it, it will contain what the file does, what is badly organized and some general tips. When you are finished, you can check out the solution.

To run the file, you can simply type:
``` bash
node /path/to/example/index.js
```

And get the results and see if it continues working after your refactor.

Good programming!

## Why call it art?
Well, I could've given it a lot of names. But I think art fits it well because I see programming as a art, it must be functional, but it also should be pretty and organized. Because 'anyone can program to a machine, but only good programmers can program to other people'. It requires time, pacience, persistance and dedication.
